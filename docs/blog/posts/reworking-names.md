# Enhanced Representation and Management of Global Identifiers in hax

In this technical overview, we present significant enhancements to the internal architecture used by the hax engine for representing and manipulating global identifiers. These updates address fundamental design limitations, greatly improving maintainability, clarity, and backend code generation precision.

## Motivation for the Improvements

Initially, hax assumed that all identifiers originated exclusively from Rust. While valid at the outset, this assumption quickly became inadequate. As hax evolved, new requirements emerged, prompting the engine to generate identifiers internally:

- **Trait pre- and post-conditions:** in hax, these are explicitly represented as concrete methods within typeclasses. Conversely, in Rust, these conditions exist only as anonymous standalone functions.
- **Explicit enum cast operations:** enum casts are primitive operations in Rust, but hax treats these casts as specialized operations, assigning distinct identifiers to them.
- **Cross-module mutually recursive item bundles:** these bundles are internally introduced by hax, necessitating the generation of unique identifiers to prevent naming conflicts.

Moreover, the previous identifier system lacked detailed metadata, such as the type of identifier (struct, function, type, etc.), complicating identifier rendering for backend tools.

## Issues with the Previous Design

Initially, identifiers were represented using slightly modified Rust `DefId`s accompanied by minimal metadata indicating the identifier's kind. This approach presumed that hax would never alter these `DefId`s but merely use those directly produced by the Rust compiler.

This assumption was quickly challenged. The need to prefix or suffix identifiers emerged early, but the introduction of new internal modules completely disrupted the assumption. Identifiers had to be relocated across modules, representing a significant departure from the original design.

As the API for manipulating identifiers grew increasingly permissive and transparent, the foundational assumption—that `DefId`s were unique, consistent, and Rust-generated—was entirely undermined. This resulted in numerous bugs in identifier rendering in backend outputs, leading to at least 16 documented issues ([#1135](https://github.com/cryspen/hax/issues/1135)).

## Our New Approach

The frontend has been enhanced to explicitly indicate the kind of each identifier, clarifying whether it represents a function, an associated type, a constant, etc. Additionally, it now provides detailed parent information, making the origin of identifiers more transparent. Alongside these improvements, we have redesigned our internal engine's identifier representation, introducing a layered structure where each layer addresses a distinct aspect.

1. **Raw Rust Identifiers:** using Rust's `DefId` type, generated from Rust to OCaml, with minor normalization to address potential duplicate references. These identifiers are immutable and cannot be arbitrarily created or altered.

2. **Explicit_def_id:** addresses Rust's ambiguity between a struct constructor and the type itself, explicitly distinguishing identifiers belonging to types from those belonging to values, enhancing clarity for backend translation.

3. **Concrete_ident:** built upon `Explicit_def_id`, this layer adds capabilities for generating fresh module names or adding hygienic suffixes. It ensures identifier uniqueness and declares constraints clearly when creating new names or namespaces.

### Simplified Identifier Views

Rust's namespace structure is highly flexible—allowing nesting of types within functions, functions within constants, and more. This complexity can reflect user-driven nesting (such as functions within functions) or mandatory relational nesting (fields within structs or associated items within implementations).

To handle this effectively, we introduced a hierarchical view for identifiers. Complex Rust identifier paths are projected into simpler, structured relational representations. This hierarchical view simplifies backend processing, reduces namespace conflicts, and better aligns with backend language constraints.

## Results

This comprehensive redesign of identifier representation and handling has resolved most previously identified naming issues and significantly enhanced the expressiveness and robustness of backend identifier rendering in hax.
