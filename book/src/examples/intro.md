# Examples

This chapter contains various examples that demonstrates how hax can
be used to prove properties about programs. Each example is
self-contained. hax being a tool that can extract Rust to various
backends, this section provides examples for each backend.

The first subsection takes some examples from [Rust by
Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/), and shows how to
prove properties on them.

The other sections present backend-specific examples.
